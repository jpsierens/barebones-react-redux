# Barebones React - Redux - ES6 - Webpack boilerplate

> The barebones needed to run an application containing react, redux, es6 with babel and Webpack

## run

```
npm start
```

The project already contains a good structure for building react apps with redux:
- actions dir where you can put your redux actions
- component dir to put your presentational components
- container dir for container components
- reducers dir for your reducers

index.js is your starting point, that's where the ```Root``` component is defined.
